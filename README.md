# RockPaperScissors
This program is the Rock, Paper, Scissors cellular automata, written in Python.

In the Rock, Paper, Scissors cellular automata, there are some number of colors, let's say three: Red, Green, Blue. Each color "eats" one other color. So perhaps Red eats Green, who eats Blue, who eats Red. When a color is eaten, it becomes the color of its predator. The result is a nice swirly pattern, like a lava lamp.
