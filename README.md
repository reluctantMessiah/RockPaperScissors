# RockPaperScissors
This program is the Rock, Paper, Scissors cellular automata, written in Python.

Each color can "eat" (i.e., take the place of) one other color. For example, red eats green, green eats blue, and blue eats red. This one simple rule is enough to give rather dynamic-looking life to a random splattering of colors.

### 3 colors that find a stable pattern.

### Another stable pattern established, among more colors.

### A long war of many shades.

## To Run:
1. `pip install pyglet`
2. `python rps.py`

Press the up arrow to add a new color.
Press the down arrow to remove a color.
